# 🗳️ Jayendra – Immutable Public Opinion Contract

A **decentralized smart contract** built on **Celo Sepolia Testnet**, designed to collect and preserve **public opinions permanently** on the blockchain.  
This project demonstrates how **blockchain immutability** can be used for transparency, trust, and open participation.

---

## 🧠 Project Description

The **Jayendra Opinion Contract** is a simple Solidity-based project that allows anyone to:

- Share their opinion with the world.  
- Store it permanently on-chain (no edits, no deletions).  
- Read opinions from anyone, anytime.

Think of it as a **public message wall** that can never be altered — a true example of *immutable records* using blockchain.

---

## ⚙️ What It Does

1. **Submit Opinion** – Any user can submit an opinion message.  
2. **Store Permanently** – The message is stored forever on the blockchain (cannot be changed).  
3. **Retrieve Opinions** – Anyone can view all submitted opinions and their authors.  
4. **Count Entries** – Get the total number of opinions stored.

## ✨ Features

✅ **Open Access** – No owner, no admin; anyone can participate.  
✅ **Immutable Data** – Opinions cannot be modified or deleted.  
✅ **Transparent** – Every opinion includes author address and timestamp.  
✅ **Lightweight & Gas Efficient** – Simple design for quick deployments.  
✅ **Beginner-Friendly** – Easy to understand and deploy on any EVM-compatible chain.
